# DiscordEuroscope 1.3.1 — VATPHIL

Discord Rich Presence for EuroScope, plus optional forwarding of ATC chat to a Discord channel webhook.

## Quick start

1. Put `DiscordEuroscope.dll` and `DiscordEuroscope_config.json` in the same folder — for VATPHIL that is `RPHI/Plugins/DiscordEuroscope/` in your sector package.
2. The VATPHIL build already has the webhook URL baked into the DLL; there is no URL setting in the config.
3. Start EuroScope, then type `.discord webhooktest` to check the webhook.

The plugin stays quiet on startup. It only shows a message when something is wrong (bad config, or Wine without a Discord bridge).

## Configuration

`DiscordEuroscope_config.json` lives next to `DiscordEuroscope.dll`. After editing it, type `.discord hotreload` in EuroScope — no restart is needed. If the file is missing, the plugin generates it.

> The webhook URL is not in the config. It is compiled into the DLL (see below). Keep a baked DLL private.

### Webhook (ATC chat → Discord)

The webhook URL is **baked into the DLL**, not read from the config. The VATPHIL build installed in `RPHI/Plugins/DiscordEuroscope/` is already baked.

The public `vatphil-latest` release DLL is a template containing a placeholder, because publishing a baked DLL would publish the webhook URL. Bake the downloaded DLL before using it:

```
WEBHOOK_URL='https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...' \
    python3 tools/bake_webhook.py --dll DiscordEuroscope.dll --out DiscordEuroscope_baked.dll
```

Then install `DiscordEuroscope_baked.dll` as `DiscordEuroscope.dll`. The URL is passed at bake time and is not stored in this repository.

Only the line format is configurable:

```json
"webhook": {
    "line_format": "**{sender}:** {message}"
}
```

- `line_format` — what each chat line looks like in Discord. Missing or empty uses `**{sender}:** {message}`.
- Placeholders: `{sender}` (callsign), `{message}` (chat text), `{time}` (UTC `HH:MM:SS`). Placeholders are replaced once; braces inside a chat message stay literal.
- Only the **ATC** chat is forwarded. Frequency chat, private messages, broadcasts and server messages are never posted.
- Messages are posted under your callsign as the webhook name, and several messages that arrive close together are combined into one post.
- Mentions are disabled, so `@everyone` and role/user mentions in chat never ping anyone.
- Messages are sent from a background thread; EuroScope never waits on Discord.

Anyone who has a baked DLL can extract the URL from it, so do not publish or share a baked DLL. The public release intentionally stays a placeholder. If the URL leaks, delete the Discord webhook, create a new one, and bake the DLL again.

If several controllers run the plugin with the same webhook, every instance will post its copy of the chat. Use the webhook on one relay instance only, or use separate webhooks per controller.

`.discord webhooktest` sends one test line through the configured `line_format` and reports whether Discord accepted it.

### Rich presence entries and images

All display text and image keys are configurable:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `discord_appid` | Discord application ID (Rich Presence app). |
| `discord_presence_large_image_key` | Default large image asset key. |
| `discord_presence_small_image_key` | Default small image asset key. |
| `sweatbox_bypass` | Skip presence updates while in sweatbox. |
| `states.idle`, `playback`, `sweatbox`, `direct` | Per-state presence. |
| `states.direct.if_observer`, `if_controller`, `if_supervisor` | Overrides depending on your rating/role. |

Each state accepts `state`, `details`, `presence_large_image_key`, `presence_small_image_key`, `presence_large_image_text`, `presence_small_image_text` and an optional `buttons` array (up to 2 `{ "label": "...", "url": "..." }` entries). An empty per-state image key falls back to the global default. Available text placeholders: `{callsign}`, `{rcallsign}`, `{frequency}`, `{current_tracked}`, `{total_inrange}`, `{total_tracked}`.

Image keys refer to **art assets on the Discord application**, not local file paths. To change the actual picture:

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), select the VATPHIL application, then **Rich Presence → Art Assets**.
2. Upload the image and give it a name, for example `vatphil_banner` or `vatphil_logo`.
3. Use that name in `discord_presence_large_image_key` / `discord_presence_small_image_key` (or a state override).
4. Type `.discord hotreload`; restart Discord if it keeps showing the old image.

The source pictures are in `discord-assets/`. The plugin cannot upload artwork to Discord by itself — that step always happens in the Developer Portal.

### Radio callsigns

`radio_callsigns` maps position callsigns to the name shown in the presence details (`{rcallsign}`). The old `DiscordEuroscope_RadioCallsigns.txt` file is no longer used.

```json
"radio_callsigns": {
    "config": {
        "load_from_ese": false,
        "path_to_ese": "..\\..\\..\\"
    },
    "custom_callsigns": {
        "^MNL_CTR$": "Manila Control",
        "^MNL_(\\d+)(?:_)CTR$": "Manila Control ACC $0"
    }
}
```

Set `load_from_ese` to `true` to read position names directly from the `.ese` file(s) in `path_to_ese`; otherwise the regex rules in `custom_callsigns` are used. `.discord hotreload` reports how many callsigns were parsed.

## Building and updating

The `Build VATPHIL plugin` workflow builds the 32-bit DLL on GitHub Actions. It runs automatically on pushes to the `VATPHIL` branch, or manually from the Actions tab. The finished `DiscordEuroscope.dll` is attached to the `vatphil-latest` prerelease, but it is a **template** with a webhook placeholder.

To install a webhook-enabled update, download the DLL and bake it first:

```
WEBHOOK_URL='https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...' \
    python3 tools/bake_webhook.py --dll DiscordEuroscope.dll --out DiscordEuroscope_baked.dll
```

Close EuroScope, replace `DiscordEuroscope.dll` in `RPHI/Plugins/DiscordEuroscope/` with the baked DLL, keep the config, and start EuroScope again. A DLL swap is not covered by `.discord hotreload` — only config changes are.

## Using the plugin on Mac or Linux (Wine)

EuroScope runs under Wine, but Discord runs as a normal Mac or Linux app. Wine can't connect the two on its own, so you need a small free bridge program called [rpc-bridge](https://github.com/EnderIce2/rpc-bridge). You only have to set it up once per Wine prefix (or CrossOver bottle).

When the plugin loads under Wine, it checks for the bridge. If it can't find it, it shows `... Discord can't be reached from Wine on its own ...` in EuroScope, which means the bridge isn't running yet. Follow the steps below. If everything is fine it stays quiet; type `.discord hotreload` if you want to see `Running under Wine ... Discord bridge found.`

The webhook does **not** need the bridge — it talks to Discord over HTTPS directly. Only Rich Presence needs it.

### Mac

1. Download the latest release from the [rpc-bridge releases page](https://github.com/EnderIce2/rpc-bridge/releases) and unzip it.
2. Open Terminal in the unzipped folder and run:
   ```
   chmod +x launchd.sh
   ./launchd.sh install
   ```
3. Run `bridge.exe` with the same Wine prefix / CrossOver bottle you use for EuroScope, and click **Install**.
4. Open the Discord app, start EuroScope, and connect. If EuroScope was already open, type `.discord hotreload`.

### Linux

1. Download the latest release from the [rpc-bridge releases page](https://github.com/EnderIce2/rpc-bridge/releases) and unzip it.
2. Run `bridge.exe` with the same Wine prefix you use for EuroScope (for Lutris: *Run EXE inside Wine prefix*), and click **Install**.
3. Open the Discord app, start EuroScope, and connect. If EuroScope was already open, type `.discord hotreload`.

If you use the Flatpak version of Discord, it also needs permission to share its connection. Run this once:

```
flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-run/discord-ipc-0 --filesystem=xdg-run/.flatpak/com.discordapp.Discord:create com.discordapp.Discord
```

To uninstall, run `bridge.exe` again and click **Remove** (on Mac, also run `./launchd.sh remove`).

## Troubleshooting

- `.discord webhooktest` says **No webhook URL is baked into this build** — you are running the template DLL; bake it with `tools/bake_webhook.py` and replace the DLL (then restart EuroScope).
- `.discord webhooktest` reports **404** or **401/403** — the webhook was deleted or the URL is wrong; create/copy it again.
- `.discord webhooktest` reports **network or URL error** — check the internet connection (and any proxy) for Wine; the webhook does not use Discord IPC.
- The webhook works but presence is blank — the Discord application ID or image asset key is wrong, or the Discord bridge isn't running under Wine.
- Config edits do nothing — run `.discord hotreload`; check that you edited the JSON next to the DLL that EuroScope actually loaded.
- `.discord hotreload` shows `Config error: ...` — the named field is missing or has the wrong type; fix it and reload again.
